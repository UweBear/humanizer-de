# Guide for agents

This file explains how to change Humanizer DE without breaking its package or prompt.

## What this repo contains

Humanizer DE is an agent skill written in Markdown. It rewrites AI-sounding German text. `SKILL.md` is the prompt that agents read. The repo has no build step.

Keep the skill portable. Do not write instructions that limit it to one or two agent tools.

## Key files

- `SKILL.md` is the source of truth and the repo's only skill file. It contains portable YAML metadata, an account of why AI text sounds the way it does, and numbered patterns grouped in seven sections and ordered by strength and frequency.
- `README.md` explains installation, use, and patterns.
- `CHANGELOG.md` holds the release notes, newest first. Old notes keep the pattern numbers their release used.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` describes the Claude plugin and points its skill loader at the root `SKILL.md`.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` lets users add this repo as a Claude marketplace.
- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` describes the Cursor plugin. Omit a `skills` path so Cursor loads the root `SKILL.md`.
- `agents/openai.yaml` holds the display name, short description, and default prompt for OpenAI-compatible agents.
- `scripts/validate-package.py` checks package files and shared values.

## Rules for changes

Keep `SKILL.md` and `README.md` in sync.

- **Language:** Instructions are in English. Watch lists, quoted phrases, and before/after examples are in German. The skill always writes its rewrite in German.
- **Patterns:** Patterns are numbered from 1 without gaps, strongest and most frequent first. A new tell earns a pattern only when no existing pattern already implies it; prefer folding it into an existing pattern. If you add, remove, or renumber a pattern, update the README tables, the README section title, and every §reference. The validator derives the count from the headings and checks that README pattern names match them.
- **Examples:** An "After" example must not add a fact, name, number, or place that the "Before" example lacks. The skill forbids this, so its own examples must not do it.
- **Upstream:** When the original Humanizer changes, check whether the change applies to German and port it. Note the upstream version in `metadata.based-on` and in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Version:** Keep the same version in `SKILL.md` under `metadata.version`, the first `CHANGELOG.md` heading, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`. Do not add a top-level `version` field to the skill.
- **Compatibility:** Keep install and use instructions neutral across agents. Names such as Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex are examples, not limits.
- **Description:** The plugin manifests use the first sentence of the `SKILL.md` description.
- **Length:** Every word of `SKILL.md` is read on each use. The validator caps it at 6,000 words; a change that adds words should earn them.
- **History:** Add a short `CHANGELOG.md` note for any behavior change or non-obvious fix.
- **Checks:** Before publishing, run `python3 scripts/validate-package.py`, `npx skills add . --list`, and `claude plugin validate .`.

## Writing style

Use Plain Language in code comments, prompts, documentation, descriptions, validation messages, and progress reports.

- Lead with the main point.
- Use common words and active voice.
- Keep sentences and paragraphs short.
- Use one term for the same item.
- Use `must` for requirements.
- Keep exact identifiers, commands, paths, schema fields, quotations, watched phrases, and behavior-bearing examples.
- Keep the full technical meaning.

## Editing the skill

- Keep the YAML metadata valid.
- Treat the prompt below the metadata as the product.
- Prefer a short, clear instruction over another exception or repeated explanation.
